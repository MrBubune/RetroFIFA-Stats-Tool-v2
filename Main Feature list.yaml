I'm making a retro fifa stats website using streamlit. I want to start with the following features:
1. Home Page:
   - This would be the introduction page to help users understand and navigate the website
   - It would also be the page to allow signing in and importing the information from their own google sheets ideally using oauth of their own google account
2. Squad Information page:
   - This would serve as a page to view the basic information about the squad with buttons to enable adding, removing and editing players
   - The following information would be entered for each player by the user through a form:
      - Season
      - Name
      - Age
      - Kit Number
      - Position 1
      - Position 2
      - Position 3
      - Position 4
      - Nationality
      - Height
      - Weight
      - Transfer Value
      - Wage
      - Contract Length
      - Role(Crucial, Important, Rotation, Sporadic, Prospect)
      - Strong Foot
      - Overall at start of season
      - Overall at end of season
3. Transfer Information page:
   - This would serve as a page to view the transfer information about the squad with a button to add a transfer
   - The following information would be entered by the user through a form:
      - Season
      - Player Name
      - Transfer Date (Optional)
      - Transfer Type (Transfer in, Transfer out, Loan in, Loan out, Loan in with option to buy, Loan out with option to buy)
      - Transfer Value (Money or % split)
4. Player stats page:
   - This would allow users to add and view the stats of each player on a match by match basis

      - Season
      - Competition
      - Opponent

   - Then the following information would be entered for each player by the user through a form:

      - Man of the Match (Optional) a checkbox
      - Started (Optional) a checkbox
      - Minutes Played
      - Match Rating

      - Shots Parried
      - Crosses Caught

   - These would then fill up the sheet with the stats for each player for that specific match
   - The sheet would then be used to calculate the overall stats for each player for the season. These include:
      - A toggle for per 90 stats
      - A toggle for per game stats

      - Percentage accuracy for Long Passes Completed to Long Passes Attempted
   - These calculated stats would then fill a page to view player stats. This page would allow to filter by match, competition and view complete stats
   - All stats would be added up except for Percentage accuracies which would be averaged by number of games
5. Team Stats Page:
   - This page would show users complete team stats per season (By adding and averaging for all players and all matches)
   - It would allow users to filter by season and competition
   - It would also Show total wins, losses and draws for each season
