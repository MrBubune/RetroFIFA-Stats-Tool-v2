I'm adding a section for stats to the retro fifa stats website using streamlit and plotly. I want to start with the following features:
1. Stats Dashboard:
  - It has 2 sub-menus:
    - Overall Player performance:
      - It would show a Bar Graph to compare single stats
      - Slider to select number of players to show
      - Dropdown to select stat
      - Lower is better toggle
      - per 90 toggle
      - Multiple seasons toggle (This allows comparing players across seasons)
      - Card for Table to show list of name, position, nationality, minutes, chosen stat
    - Nulti-Stat Comparison:
      - It would show a 2D/3D scatter plot to compare multiple stats
      - Slider to select number of players to show
      - Dropdown to select 2 or 3 stats
      - Toggle for trendlines
      - Toggle for median Lines
      - Toggle for per 90
      - Multiple seasons toggle (This allows comparing players across seasons)
      - Correlation under plot
      - Card for Table to show list of name, position, nationality, minutes, chosen stats
      - Hover info shows name, selected stats, position, age, minutes
2. Player Comparison:
  - A radar chart to compare multiple players
  - Drop down to select 2 or 3 players
  - Option to customize colours
  - Select category preset, the presets are:
      - Attack (Match Rating, Goals, Shots, Shots on target, Assists, Key Passes, Dribbles, Crosses, Fouled, Penalties Conceded, Possession Lost)
      - Midfield (Match Rating, Goals, Assists, Passes (Attempted/Completed), Dribbles (Attempted/Completed), Tackles, Interceptions, Possession Won/Lost, Key Passes, Key Dribbles)
      - Defence (Match Rating, Goals, Own Goals, Tackles, Interceptions, Clearances, Headers, Blocks, Possession Won/Lost, Penalties Conceded)
      - Goalkeeper (Match Rating, Saves, Shots Caught, Shots Parried, Crosses Caught, Goals Conceded, Possession Won/Lost, Balls Stripped)
      - Possession (Passes (Attempted/Completed), Dribbles (Attempted/Completed), Key Passes, Key Dribbles, Possession Won/Lost)
  - Filter card to allow further editing of the category preset
  - Checkbox to display normalized values instead (Preserve original value for readability)
  - Checkbox for per 90 stats
  - Checkbox to enable fill colours (Lower opacity, Transparent if diabled)
  - Stat breakdown table within card listing stats and for 2 players, higher value is green, lower value is red, and if 3 middle value is yellow
3. Player Scout Report:
